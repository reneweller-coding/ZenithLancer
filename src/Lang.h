 *        and pass through T(): in English they are looked up in data/lang/en.txt ("German = English" lines; a text
 *        without a line stays German). The data carries both itself: "title"/"title_en", "desc"/"desc_en", and the
 *        stories in data/story/de and data/story/en (L() picks the one of the language, German where English is
 *        missing).
